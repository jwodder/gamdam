Git-Annex Mass Downloader and Metadata-er

``gamdam`` is the Git-Annex Mass Downloader and Metadata-er.  It takes a stream
of JSON Lines describing what to download and what metadata each file has,
downloads them in parallel to a git-annex_ repository, attaches the metadata
using git-annex's metadata facilities, and commits the results.

This program was written as an experiment/proof-of-concept for a larger program
and is now only minimally maintained.
